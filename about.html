                    <p class="card-text">I’ve always loved to cook. To me, food is about community and togetherness. I grew up preparing food with my family. Food has become an important way for me to communicate with the people I love and my communities.
                      <br/> 
                      <br/> 

                        In the fall of 2016 I got the idea that I could make a better hummus than what I was getting in the store. When I get on a path I get obsessive. I spent months trying out different chickpeas, cooking methods, tahinis and spice blends.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        
                        But it wasn’t until I went to I went to Tel Aviv August of 2017 that I found a new world of hummus. Israeli hummus was lightyears away from American hummus. It looked and tasted different, had a different texture and smell. It was basically a different food altogether! It was a hummus revelation! 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        
                        I came home determined to make creamy, smooth, luxurious, deeply satisfying and satiating hummus. I wanted hummus that I could eat for a snack, a meal, or anytime. I wanted hummus that made me feel energized and focused. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        
                        Dan’s Hummus is my contribution to the community. Creating and providing a healthy food that can be eaten as a snack or meal is how I can be most useful to those around me.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        
                        Beyond hummus I love staying active with Jiu Jitsu and yoga. The lessons of focus, intent, and work ethic that I learn and practice with these activities inspires the rest of my life. </p>
